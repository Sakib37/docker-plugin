# VNF Scripts

This repository contains some of the scripts used by the examples VNFDs. If you want to make use of them, make sure you have configured your `vnfPackageLocation` correctly in your VNFD: 

```
         ...
            "vnfPackageLocation":"https://github.com/openbaton/vnf-scripts.git",
         ...
```
